# Microsoft API's for Digital Justice

This is a repository that groups together a bunch of API's definitions availabe in Microsoft Graph (it includes O365 and Microsoft Teams) that could be easily leveraged in the context of third-party applications in the **Digital Justice** space.

The intent of this effort is to facilitate and speed up the integration process between Microsoft's products and services with third-party applications brought to the market by Microsoft's partners and customers in Digital Justice.

# Context

The world is changing faster than ever. Court systems can't afford to slow down, they need to accelerate digital transformation and serve justice in the way modern societies expect, especially as a result of the pandemic.

Some relevant information:

* In the US alone, more than 100 milion cases are filled every year in the state level;
* In 2019, the Court of Justice of the European Union registered 168,286 procedural documents;
* In Australia’s Federal Court and Federal Circuit Court, 16,125 matters were filed in 2018–2019;

Judges and courtrooms need a virtual court solution that can handle various types of hearings, workloads, and conditions, as well as integrate case files and documents.

Microsoft can help and that's the why the repository exists: to help partners and customers build solutions based on the latest needs of justice departments. Accelerate these developments by integrating it’s solutions with Microsoft products and services through REST APIs calls (widely known as [Microsoft Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview)).
