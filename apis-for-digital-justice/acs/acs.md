Azure Communication Services (ACS) allows you to easily add real-time multimedia voice, video, and telephony-over-IP communications features to your applications. The Communication Services client libraries also allow you to add chat and SMS functionality to your communications solutions.

Companies building solutions for virtual hearings can benefit of ACS' APIs to embed rich communication capabilities out-of-the-box, enabling built-in conference calls, chatting, and more.
